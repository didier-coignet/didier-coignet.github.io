## Week One ##

### Illusions

**Our intuitions can be misleading**
#### Nurses and pain
 * Nurses intuitions about pain : pain short in length even if intense is better.
 * Tested by doing scientific experiments ( cf ted talks Daniel Ari ).
 * Conclusion : 
    * nurses where wrong and didn't challenge their intuitions : 
	* low pain for longer and going in decreasing pain intensity is actually what people prefer.
#### Visual illusions 

We all see what our brain tell us we see. we are all subject to visual illusions like double pisa tower , the right picture will seem to lean more toward the right. Its a good example of cognitive bias.

### Defaults Decisions

**The path of least resistance is the one the most followed**

#### organ donor form  : opt-in or opt-out 
 * We belive we form rational decision
 * Choice Architecture
	* environment
	* Defaults
	* complexity
 * Justification by stories of unconscious choices

#### Generics drugs

 * Branded drugs are given by default. People will keep buying the default choice even if its more expensive and ther informed.
Separate preference and status-quo **Forced choice** is the good experimental method in this case.

 * The more choice the more the default will be chosen. hip replacement or ibuprofene. if doc forgot ibuprofene cancel hip replacement. if one drug more keep one going with hip replacement.
 
#### Do we know our preferences
 
  * use our environment to choose for us.
  * 3 reasons u love someone or 10 reasons : 3 reasons says after questionary they love more than 10 reasons.
Temporary mindsets influence decisions.
Influence by adding a relative third choice less interesting : see popcorn sizes or rome / paris/ rome minus => Decoy Effect. 
framework of evaluation.
